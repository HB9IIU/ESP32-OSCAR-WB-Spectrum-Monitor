Hello Oscar Friends,

The holidays are just around the corner, and it's the perfect time for some tinkering! Why not build your own Oscar 100 Wideband Monitor to watch DATV activities?

With the terrible winter weather keeping me indoors and TV programs that could put anyone to sleep, I decided to keep myself entertained by coding this little project. I thought, "Why not share it? Someone out there might actually enjoy it more than my TV options!"

All you need is:

An ESP32
A 4" TFT screen
A few Dupont cables
That’s it! For just around $15, you can have a lot of fun assembling it. The best part? No coding experience is required—just install PlatformIO in Visual Studio Code, and you’re good to go.

The project is open source, free, and tweakable, so feel free to make it your own.

All the details are available on my GitHub page: [Insert GitHub Link Here]

If you build one, please share your creation here and suggest any improvements. As I always say at work, "There is room for improvement!" Let’s see what everyone comes up with!

Happy Holidays and 73!
